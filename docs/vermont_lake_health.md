## Vermont Lake Health Analysis

**Project description:** The focus of this project was to provides an  analysis of lake water health in Vermont. The dataset contains decades of chemical tests of lake water across more than 400 lakes in the state. We combined chemical measurements data with land use survey data, population density, and geospatial data. Our goal was to understand how lake health has changed over time and with respect to geographic region and population growth. The determination of lake health was done through a derived metric that was based on the rate of change of chemicals present.
