## Machine Learning and Data Science Projects

### [Topic Analysis and Word2Vec](/Topic_analysis_word2vec)

Examination of the yelp dataset through topic analysis and word2vec vector embeddings. Using python, spaCy and gensim I created a preprocessing pipeline, trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and a Word2Vec model. Every step used generators to stream the documents from disk to minimize memory utilization and ensure optimal performance.<br>

### [Youtube Video Popularity Prediction](/youtube_popularity.md)
Predict the popularity of a youtube cooking video based on the thumbnail, subtitles, bit rate, duration, and other types of metadata associated with the video. We used A CNN to transform the thumbnails into a usable predictive feature for a stacking regressor model. This project was done in collaboration with teamates Corbin Callahan and Jeffrey Olson.<br>

### [Twitter Bot Detection](/twitter_bot_detection.md)
Classify whether a twitter user is a bot account. We accomplished this with the combination of a neural net and an ensemble stacking classifier. This project was done in collaboration with teamates Rania El Shenety and Jeffrey Olson<br>

## Database Projects

### [Relational Database of the Yelp Dataset](/yelp_database.md)

Creation of an SQLite database containing the yelp dataset using python and SQLalchemy. I used this database to do a quick inspection and network analysis of the user relationships contained within.<br>

## Data Analysis Projects

### [Vermont Lake Health Analysis](/vermont_lake_health.md)
Examination of lake health in Vermont in relation to human activity, as measured through chemical tests over decades on more than 400 lakes. This project was done in collaboration with teamates Anze Zorn and Jeffrey Olson<br>

## Other Projects

### [Kmeans with Automatic Optimal Clustering](/kmeans_optimalk.md)
Custom KMeans estimator in scikit-learn that finds the optimal number of clusters based on the Calinski and Harabasz score and the Davies-Bouldin score.<br>

### [Testing Adaboost Algorithm with Different Base Estinators](https://github.com/Alkoopman85/Adaboost-Comparison)
Explores the Adaboost algorithm using different base estimators

### [Seaborn Jointplot Tutorial](https://github.com/Alkoopman85/Seaborn-jointplt-and-joint-grid-tutorial)
A tutorial on how to plot and customize the jointplot function and JointGrid class in the seaborn plotting library
