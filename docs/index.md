## Machine Learning and Data Science

### [Youtube Video Popularity Prediction](/youtube_popularity.md)

Predict the popularity of a youtube cooking video based on the thumbnail, subtitles, bit rate, duration, and other types of metadata associated with the video. We used A CNN to transform the thumbnails into a usable predictive feature for a stacking regressor model. This project was done in collaboration with teammates Corbin Callahan and Jeffrey Olson.<br>

### [Twitter Bot Detection](/twitter_bot_detection.md)

Classify whether a twitter user is a bot account. We accomplished this with the combination of a neural net and an ensemble stacking classifier. This project was done in collaboration with teammates Rania El Shenety and Jeffrey Olson<br>

### [Topic Analysis of Yelp Reviews](/Topic_analysis_word2vec.md)

Examination of the yelp dataset through topic analysis and word2vec vector embeddings. Using python, spaCy and gensim I created a preprocessing pipeline, trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and a Word2Vec model. Every step used generators to stream the documents from disk to minimize memory utilization and ensure optimal performance.<br>

### [Kmeans with Automatic Optimal Clustering](/kmeans_optimalk.md)

Custom KMeans estimator in scikit-learn that finds the optimal number of clusters based on the Calinski and Harabasz score and the Davies-Bouldin score.<br>

## Data Analysis

### [Vermont Lake Health Analysis](/vermont_lake_health.md)

Examination of lake health in Vermont in relation to human activity, as measured through chemical tests over decades on more than 400 lakes. This project was done in collaboration with teamates Anze Zorn and Jeffrey Olson<br>

## Database Design

### [Relational Database of the Yelp Dataset](/yelp_database.md)

Creation of an SQLite database containing the yelp dataset using python and SQLalchemy. I used this database to do a quick inspection and network analysis of the user relationships contained within.<br>

## Other Projects

### [How I built a Home Lab from Recycled Hardware](/pdfs/homelab_buildbook.pdf)

A step by step process for a home lab build from recycled hardware. Here I took five computers past their end of life and created a development desktop, a nas like storage and NFS share, and a proxmox virtual environment cluster.
