  About: 
  <br>
    I am currently a Lecturer in Information in the Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) 
    program at The University of Michigan School of Information. I have a deep passion for 
    all things machine learning especially natural language processing and reinforcement
    learning.
    I posses a masters degree in Applied Data Science from The University of Michigan,
    where I achieved a 4.0 GPA. My undergraduate degree is in mathematics, with a minor
    in economics from the University of Colorado at Boulder which is where I found my passion
    for data science.
