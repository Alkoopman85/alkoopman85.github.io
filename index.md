### [Topic Analysis and Word2Vec](/Topic_analysis_word2vec.md)

Examination of the yelp dataset through topic analysis and word2vec vector embeddings. Using python, spaCy and gensim I created a preprocessing pipeline, trained a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, and a Word2Vec model. Every step used generators to stream the documents from disk to minimize memory utilization.
